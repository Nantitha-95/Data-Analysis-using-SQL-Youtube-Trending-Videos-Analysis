# Data-Analysis-using-SQL-Youtube-Trending-Videos-Analysis

#### Data source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

This project focuses on analyzing Youtube trending videos using SQL and visualizing the findings using Tableau Public. The dataset used for analysis was obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com) and includes columns such as video_id, Country, publishedat, channelTitle, categoryid, trending_date, view_count, likes, dislikes, comment_count, id, and title of the category (category_id table). Additionally, the time_taken_to_trend was calculated using the publishedat and trending_date columns.

#### Tasks Performed:

Data cleaning: The data was cleaned using PostgreSQL (PgAdmin4) by addressing missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies.
Data analysis: SQL queries were used to perform various analysis tasks, such as identifying the channels,categories based on view counts, likes, dislikes, and comment counts.
Data visualization: Visualizations were created using Tableau Public to visually communicate the findings and provide insights into the trends and patterns in Youtube trending videos.

#### Skills Utilized:

SQL for data cleaning and analysis.
Tableau Public for data visualization.
